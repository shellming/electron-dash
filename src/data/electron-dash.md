## How to Play Electron Dash  

### Master the Basics  
In *Electron Dash*, you take control of a glowing electron racing endlessly through a futuristic tube suspended in space. Your goal is simple—survive as long as possible while collecting points and avoiding destruction. The game tests your reflexes, timing, and spatial awareness in a constantly shifting 3D environment where one wrong move can send you spiraling into the void. Whether you are a first-time player or a seasoned fan of skill-based runners, Electron Dash offers an immediately accessible yet deeply rewarding challenge.

### Controls and Movement  
Movement in *Electron Dash* is intuitive yet precise, allowing you to focus purely on your reflexes. Use the **left** and **right arrow keys** or the **A** and **D** keys to rotate the cylindrical tunnel around your electron. This mechanic keeps your character running along the inner surface of the tube, aligning you with safe pathways and avoiding deadly hazards. When an obstacle appears, such as a break in the track or a glowing laser beam, use the **up arrow key** or **W key** to **jump**. Timing your jumps correctly will be crucial to clearing wide gaps and avoiding unstable tiles that collapse shortly after contact.

### Obstacles and Hazards  
As you progress in Electron Dash, the tube becomes littered with challenges designed to push your reaction time to its limits. **Unstable tiles** crumble seconds after you step on them, forcing quick decisions. **Lasers** project across the tunnel in rhythmic patterns, demanding precision dodging. **Gaps in the track** test your jumping accuracy, while the constant forward motion leaves no room for hesitation. The pace quickens over time, increasing both the tension and the adrenaline rush.

### Objective and Progress  
There's no finish line in *Electron Dash*—it's all about how long you can stay alive while maintaining control. The further you run in Electron Dash, the higher your score climbs. Each attempt encourages you to refine your timing, sharpen your reflexes, and push your limits in this intense, neon-charged endless runner experience.

## Tips & Strategies for Electron Dash

- **Master the Tube Rotation Early**  
  The core challenge of *Electron Dash* lies in controlling the rotation of the tube. Practice subtle left and right movements instead of over-rotating—small corrections help you stay centered and ready for upcoming obstacles.

- **Time Your Jumps Precisely**  
  Jumping too early or too late can send your electron straight into the void. Use visual cues from tile edges to anticipate when to leap, especially over unstable or disappearing tiles. In Electron Dash, a well-timed jump often makes all the difference between survival and a reset.

- **Stay Alert for Hazard Patterns**  
  Obstacles like lasers and gaps in Electron Dash often follow rhythmic patterns. Spend some runs observing their timing and sequences. Once you learn the rhythm, you can predict and react with confidence rather than relying on split-second guesses.

- **Use Momentum to Your Advantage**  
  The electron's smooth acceleration allows you to glide over small gaps and transition seamlessly between platforms. Avoid unnecessary stops; continuous movement often helps maintain control and rhythm through tricky sections. Veteran Electron Dash players know that keeping a consistent pace is often safer than braking at every obstacle.

- **Prioritize Safety Over Speed**  
  While the urge to go fast is natural, rushing often leads to missteps. Play conservatively until you can recognize how different hazards interact. Once your reflexes align with the pace of Electron Dash, you can gradually increase your speed and chase higher scores.

- **Keep an Eye on the Background**  
  The Tron-inspired visuals in Electron Dash can be mesmerizing, but they can also distract you. Focus on your path ahead and use the bright grid lines to gauge distance and trajectory, especially when multiple hazards appear simultaneously.

- **Practice in Short Bursts**  
  Because *Electron Dash* is an endless runner, it rewards persistence and repetition. Short, focused sessions help you improve reaction time without fatigue, making each subsequent run sharper and more controlled.

- **Learn From Each Run**  
  Every failure in Electron Dash is a learning opportunity. After each game over, recall the moment things went wrong and adjust your approach. Players who analyze their mistakes and adapt consistently post better scores over time.
