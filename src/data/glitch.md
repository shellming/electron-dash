## How to Play Glitch

### Understanding the Objective  
In **Glitch**, your goal is simple yet deceptively challenging: navigate through a series of glitching platforms and puzzling environments to reach the finish door at the end of each level. Every stage introduces new mechanics, traps, and obstacles that require both quick reactions and clever thinking. While progressing, you’ll encounter hidden paths, interactive puzzles, and enemies that will push your skills to the limit. The ultimate challenge is not just surviving—but mastering the glitch itself.

### Core Mechanics  
The game combines precise platforming with brain-teasing logic puzzles. You’ll find platforms that disappear, reappear, or behave unpredictably, forcing you to adapt on the fly. Some puzzles demand the correct sequence of actions, while others require timing and coordination. Boss battles punctuate key milestones, demanding strategic movement and keen observation to exploit their weaknesses. Power-ups scattered throughout levels can temporarily boost your abilities—such as enhanced jump height or faster movement—while permanent upgrades can be discovered in secret areas.

### Controls  
Glitch is easy to pick up thanks to intuitive controls, but true mastery comes from precision and timing:

- **Movement:** Press **A** or **left arrow key** to move left, and **D** or **right arrow key** to move right.  
- **Jumping:** Press **W**, **up arrow key**, or **space** to jump. Mastering jump timing is crucial for overcoming gaps and dodging hazards.  
- Use movement and jumping in combination to perform advanced maneuvers like edge grabs or quick dashes between platforms.

### Tips for Success  
- **Observe Before Acting:** Many puzzles rely on understanding platform patterns. Take a moment to watch their behavior.  
- **Time Your Moves:** Glitching platforms often appear briefly—jump at the exact moment for safe passage.  
- **Use Power-Ups Wisely:** Save game-changing boosts for challenging sections or boss fights.  
- **Explore Thoroughly:** Hidden upgrades can make later levels much easier if discovered early.  

Whether you prefer fast-paced action or thoughtful puzzle-solving, **Glitch** rewards players who can adapt, plan, and execute perfectly under pressure.

## Tips & Strategies for Glitch

- **Plan Before You Jump:** Every level in *Glitch* is designed with layered puzzles that reward careful observation. Before making a move, take a moment to analyze the environment—look for platform patterns, enemy cycles, and potential traps. Rushing can lead to quick mistakes, especially in glitching areas where timing is everything.  

- **Use Glitches to Your Advantage:** Not every “glitch” is a setback—some are key to solving puzzles. Experiment with unstable platforms and distorted areas to find secret paths or shortcuts. Understanding how glitches alter movement or physics can unlock new strategies for reaching hard-to-access areas.  

- **Master Your Movement:** The combination of jumping, dashing, and climbing defines success in this game. Practice chaining movements smoothly to handle complex sequences. Momentum control—knowing when to stop or adjust mid-air—can mean the difference between clearing a section or falling into a trap.  

- **Study Enemy Patterns:** From basic drones to boss-level adversaries, each enemy has predictable attack patterns. Watch closely before engaging. If you time your attacks or dodges correctly, you can take minimal damage while staying on the offensive.  

- **Collect Power-Ups Wisely:** Power-ups aren’t just bonuses—they can change how you approach a level. Save certain upgrades for more difficult areas or tricky puzzles that require specific abilities. Experiment with combinations to find what best fits your playstyle.  

- **Explore Every Corner:** Hidden areas and secret rooms often contain valuable upgrades or bonus puzzles. Don’t rush to the exit; backtracking with newly unlocked abilities can reveal previously inaccessible paths. Exploration often rewards persistence.  

- **Practice Makes Perfect:** The later levels demand precision and mastery of core mechanics. If you’re struggling with a section, replay earlier stages to refine your skills. Gradual improvement is key—*Glitch* rewards players who learn through trial and error.
