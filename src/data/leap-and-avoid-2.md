## How to Play Leap and Avoid 2

Leap and Avoid 2 challenges your reflexes, precision, and strategic thinking as you guide a nimble white ball through increasingly perilous environments. Mastering its mechanics is key to climbing the leaderboards and discovering all the hidden secrets scattered across the game’s treacherous caves and sleek high-tech labs.  

### Core Mechanics  
The white ball is your avatar, and survival depends on keeping it safely on white platforms while avoiding contact with black ones — which instantly end your run. Some levels feature moving platforms, disappearing paths, or environmental hazards designed to test your timing and decision-making. Coins scattered along each route serve as both a score booster and currency for upgrades, such as shields that provide temporary invulnerability or speed boosts for faster traversal.  

Hidden areas reward exploration, offering bonus coins and secret treasures. Many paths require daring jumps, clever momentum use, or precise landings. Failure to keep moving efficiently can lead to deadly falls or traps, so planning your route is just as important as agility.  

### Controls  
- **Arrow Left / Arrow Right** or **A / D**: Move the ball horizontally  
- **R**: Restart the current level instantly  
- **P**: Toggle pause, allowing you to catch your breath or strategize  
- **Left Mouse Button**: Interact with menus and in-game UI elements  

### Objective  
Your mission is to complete each stage without falling or hitting black platforms, collecting as many coins as possible along the way. Progress unlocks new environments with unique platform patterns and hazard types. Accumulated coins can be used to purchase upgrades, helping you overcome tougher challenges and chase higher scores.  

The ultimate goal is to combine skillful platforming with smart resource management — balancing your desire for coin collection with the need for safe traversal — all while racing against time to secure a top position on the leaderboard. Every leap matters, and every mistake brings the thrill of starting anew.

## Tips & Strategies for Leap and Avoid 2

Mastering *Leap and Avoid 2* takes more than quick reflexes—it’s about precision, timing, and strategic upgrades. These proven tips will help you survive longer, collect more coins, and climb the global leaderboard with confidence.

- **Study Platform Patterns Early**  
  Each level introduces unique movement rhythms for platforms. Spend your first few runs observing patterns rather than rushing forward. Once you recognize timing cycles, you can predict safe leaps and avoid sudden drops.

- **Use Momentum to Your Advantage**  
  Keep your ball moving fluidly instead of stopping abruptly. Momentum helps you clear longer gaps and makes mid-air adjustments smoother. Quick left-right corrections can mean the difference between landing safely or hitting a deadly black platform.

- **Prioritize Shield Upgrades First**  
  Coins can be scarce at the start, so invest in shields before speed boosts. A shield gives you one mistake’s worth of protection—perfect for learning tricky sections without losing progress instantly.

- **Restart When Timing Feels Off**  
  If you mistime a jump sequence early in a run, don’t hesitate to press **R**. Restarting keeps your rhythm sharp and prevents wasted attempts when the level flow becomes unsynchronized.

- **Watch for Hidden Coin Trails**  
  Some paths are deliberately out of sight behind walls or beneath platforms. Explore the edges of levels carefully—one alternate route can lead to massive coin clusters and secret rewards.

- **Pause to Plan the Route**  
  Use **P** liberally to freeze the action and mentally chart your next five seconds. This is especially useful in dynamic stages with shifting platforms or fast-moving obstacles.

- **Stay Calm Under Pressure**  
  The game rewards composure. If your ball starts near several black hazards, slow your tempo and wait for openings rather than forcing quick jumps. Controlled, patient movement consistently yields better scores.
