## How to Play Splotch!  

Splotch! is a fast-paced, precision-based platformer designed to challenge both your reflexes and your patience. The goal is deceptively simple: navigate through each perilous level and reach the flag at the end without falling victim to traps. However, with hidden pitfalls, tricky jumps, and sudden surprises, every movement counts — one mistake means starting the level from scratch.  

### Objectives  
Your primary objective is to complete each stage by reaching the flag. The path to victory isn’t straightforward; you’ll need to memorize patterns, adapt to unexpected hazards, and execute flawless jumps. Every level rewards careful observation and precise timing, so rushing blindly forward is almost certain to get you “splotched.”  

### Core Mechanics  
The gameplay revolves around tight, responsive platforming physics. Your character’s movement is sensitive to momentum, so short taps and long presses affect jump height. The challenge comes from mastering the rhythm between movement and jumping while avoiding traps like disappearing platforms, spike pits, and sudden enemies.  

The difficulty increases progressively — early levels introduce basic mechanics and obstacles, while later stages demand perfect execution of advanced maneuvers such as mid-air direction changes and double-timing jumps between moving hazards.  

### Controls  

**On Desktop:**  
- **A/D or ←/→** — Move left or right  
- **W, ↑ or Spacebar** — Jump  

**On Mobile:**  
- Use intuitive **on-screen buttons** for movement and jumping  

**Gamepad Support:**  
- Move and jump using your analog stick/d-pad and assigned jump button for a console-like experience  

### Tips for Success  
- **Take your time:** Rushing often leads to mistakes. Learn each section before making your move.  
- **Study the traps:** Recognize patterns in disappearing platforms and enemy behavior.  
- **Use momentum:** Some jumps require you to build up speed for the right trajectory.  
- **Stay persistent:** Every failure teaches you something — adapt and improve.  

Mastering Splotch! requires patience, quick thinking, and precise inputs. The reward? The satisfaction of conquering each unforgiving stage, flag by flag.  

## Tips & Strategies for Splotch!

### 1. Master Short and Long Jumps  
Timing is everything in Splotch! Practice both quick hops and full leaps to navigate varying platform distances. Holding the jump button longer increases height and distance—perfect for clearing wide gaps—but short taps can help avoid overshooting into traps.

### 2. Learn Trap Patterns  
Hidden hazards follow predictable routines. Instead of rushing, watch their movements for a few seconds. Once you recognize their timing, you can confidently weave through them without falling victim to surprise splats.

### 3. Stay Calm After a Reset  
One wrong move sends you back to the start, but frustration leads to more mistakes. Treat each failure as an opportunity to refine your run. A composed mindset boosts reaction time and precision.

### 4. Use Momentum Wisely  
Combining movement and jumping creates smoother transitions across platforms. Running into a jump can sometimes give the extra lift needed for tricky gaps, but be cautious—momentum can also carry you straight into hazards.

### 5. Break the Level into Mental Checkpoints  
Since respawns happen at the start, mentally divide the stage into “safe progress markers.” Focus on passing one section cleanly before tackling the next, reducing the psychological pressure of the full run.

### 6. Practice with Both Keyboard and Gamepad  
If you’re on desktop, experiment with input devices. Keyboard offers quick, responsive control, while a gamepad may feel more natural for precise movements. Choose the one that suits your reflexes best.

### 7. Don’t Neglect Mobile Controls  
On mobile, the on-screen buttons can be less precise than physical controls. Adjust your grip and hand position to avoid accidental presses, and remember to take advantage of any sensitivity options to improve accuracy.
