## Introduction  

**Mono Move** tests your patience, timing, and rhythm like never before.  

In a world where one misstep means instant failure, *Mono Move* invites players into a deceptively simple yet brutally precise platforming experience. With just one button to control every move, each click or tap shifts gravity and momentum, demanding absolute focus and razor-sharp reflexes. It’s the kind of game where milliseconds count and mastery feels immensely rewarding.  

Perfect for quick sessions or hours of intense retries, this gravity-defying challenge is all about persistence and precision. Whether you’re chasing flawless runs or simply trying to survive all nine fiendishly designed levels, *Mono Move* proves that simplicity doesn’t mean easy—and that true skill comes from mastering control, timing, and a bit of chaos.

## How to Play Mono Move

Mono Move is all about precision, timing, and mastering the art of gravity-switching to navigate increasingly tricky obstacle courses. The gameplay may look simple at first glance, but every level is a test of reflexes, planning, and patience.  

### Objective  
Your main goal is to complete all 9 levels without colliding into obstacles or falling out of bounds. The fewer collisions you make, the better your overall performance. Each stage presents new challenges, requiring quick reactions and strategic movement to successfully reach the finish line.  

### Core Mechanics  
Mono Move’s standout feature is its **gravity-switching mechanic**. Your character moves forward automatically, but with every input, gravity flips — pulling you toward the ceiling or the floor. You’ll need to switch gravity at the right moment to dodge incoming blocks, speed traps, and moving hazards. Timing is everything: switching too early or too late will send you straight into danger.  

The game’s level design seamlessly blends momentum with precision. Some segments demand rapid, consecutive switches, while others force you to anticipate obstacle patterns and wait for the perfect opening. As you progress, stages become faster, more complex, and less forgiving — amplifying the challenge and rewarding skillful play.  

### Controls  
- **Left Mouse Button or Spacebar:** Switch gravity (your sole movement mechanic)  
- **P:** Pause the game to take a breather  
- **M:** Mute the sound effects and background music  

### Tips for Success  
- Watch obstacle patterns closely before making a move.  
- Practice timing your switches to avoid clipping edges or moving hazards.  
- Use pauses strategically if you need to refocus during intense sections.  
- Stay calm — panic switching often leads to quick losses.  

Mastering Mono Move is about balancing speed with precision. One wrong move and gravity will send you into peril, but nail your timing and you’ll glide through each stage with style.

## Tips & Strategies for Mono Move

- **Master the Gravity Switch Timing**  
  The core mechanic of Mono Move revolves around swapping gravity with precision. Practice the rhythm and delay between your clicks or spacebar presses—switching too early or late can send you straight into an obstacle.

- **Plan Ahead Before Each Jump**  
  Every level is designed with traps and tight spaces. Scan the path ahead and anticipate where you’ll need to switch gravity before encountering dangerous blocks or moving hazards.

- **Stay Calm During Difficult Sections**  
  Mono Move is intentionally rage-inducing, but panic leads to mistakes. Keep your movements deliberate, and resist the urge to spam inputs when under pressure.

- **Use Pauses Strategically**  
  Press **P** if the level is overwhelming. A quick break can help reset your focus and let you study the obstacle patterns before making your next move.

- **Minimize Collisions for Better Control**  
  Contact with obstacles slows you down and increases frustration. Aim to keep your movement fluid—once you establish momentum, avoid unnecessary gravity switches that can break your flow.

- **Test Gravity Switches in Safe Zones**  
  Some levels allow for small “buffer areas” with no immediate hazards. Use these spaces to confidently rehearse your timing before tackling the next tricky segment.

- **Replay Completed Levels for Practice**  
  Don’t rush straight to the harder stages—repetition on earlier levels helps refine your reaction speed and teaches you valuable patterns that will reappear later in the game.
