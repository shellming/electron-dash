## How to Play Adventure Jumper

### Mastering the Basics  
In *Adventure Jumper*, every jump counts. The goal is simple yet challenging: guide your character safely to the end of each level while avoiding hazards and defeating bosses that guard your progress. The game consists of three levels, each escalating in difficulty with tighter jumps, more aggressive enemies, and trickier terrain layouts. Precision and timing are the keys to survival.

### Controls and Movement  
You can move using either the **WASD keys** or the **arrow keys**.  
- **Left / Right (A or ←, D or →):** Move your character horizontally across the platform.  
- **Up (W or ↑):** Jump to clear gaps or dodge enemy attacks.  
- **Down (S or ↓):** Crouch or drop through certain platforms when available.  

Though simple on paper, the controls require finesse—the smallest mistimed press can send your character into a pit or directly into the path of an enemy. Longer presses grant higher jumps, so experiment to find the perfect rhythm for each obstacle.

### Gameplay Mechanics  
Each level introduces new types of enemies and traps. You’ll face moving platforms, falling hazards, and clever enemy placement designed to test your reflexes. Contact with an enemy or spike resets your progress to the last checkpoint, keeping the pressure high but the game fair. Collectible items may appear throughout a stage, rewarding you with extra points or power-ups that make tough sections slightly easier.

### Objective  
Defeat the boss at the end of each level to advance. Boss fights require learning unique attack patterns and striking during brief vulnerability windows. Timing and patience pay off—master these encounters, and you’ll conquer *Adventure Jumper’s* toughest challenges. Whether you’re chasing a faster completion time or aiming for a flawless run, every jump brings you closer to mastering this fast-paced test of skill.

## Tips & Strategies for Adventure Jumper  

- **Master Short and Long Jumps**  
  Timing is everything in Adventure Jumper. Practice tapping your jump key lightly for short hops and holding it down for longer leaps. This precision helps you navigate tight platforms and avoid overshooting jumps.  

- **Observe Enemy Patterns Before Engaging**  
  Each enemy follows a predictable movement or attack cycle. Take a few seconds to watch their behavior before rushing in — this will help you identify safe windows to pass or attack.  

- **Use Momentum to Your Advantage**  
  Continuous movement in the right direction can help you clear wider gaps and dodge hazards more efficiently. Avoid stopping mid-jump unless absolutely necessary, as momentum is critical in speed-based sections.  

- **Prioritize Survival Over Speed**  
  While it may be tempting to race through levels, rushing often leads to mistakes. Move deliberately, especially when facing complex platform arrangements or multiple enemies at once.  

- **Plan Boss Encounters Carefully**  
  Boss fights are more about patience than brute force. Learn their attack patterns, find safe zones, and strike only when you’re sure you can avoid retaliation.  

- **Manage Your Camera Awareness**  
  Keep an eye on both your immediate platform and what’s ahead. Being aware of upcoming hazards allows you to prepare jumps in advance rather than react at the last second.  

- **Practice Level Sections Individually**  
  If you’re struggling with a specific area, replay that section until it feels natural. Mastering small segments builds confidence and helps you tackle full levels with fewer mistakes.
