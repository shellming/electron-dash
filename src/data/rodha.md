## How to Play Rodha

Rodha is a skill-based 2D platformer where precision jumping and quick reflexes are key to survival. Your main goal is to navigate through 60 increasingly challenging levels, dodging hazards and collecting coins while progressing toward your destination. Every stage introduces new obstacles and layouts, ensuring that gameplay stays fresh, fast-paced, and rewarding.  

### Objective  
The primary objective is to reach the end of each level without losing all your lives. Along the way, you’ll gather coins that can be used in the in-game shop to unlock unique character skins. Obstacles such as cannons, spinning saws, moving platforms, and other mechanical traps are strategically placed to slow you down or knock you out. If you fall victim to these dangers, you’ll respawn at the last checkpoint rather than starting the entire level over—making progress feel fair yet challenging.  

### Game Mechanics  
Rodha focuses on precision platforming. Timing your jumps and controlling your momentum is essential, as some platforms move, disappear, or are guarded by hazards. Coins are scattered throughout the stages, encouraging exploration and risky maneuvers. Portals provide a quick way to transition between different sections of a level, adding variety and surprise to the pacing.  

The shop contains up to 12 unlockable skins, letting you customize your avatar as you wish. Additionally, players can switch between multiple color schemes for visual comfort, making the game accessible for long play sessions.  

### Controls  
Rodha’s controls are intuitive yet require skillful execution:  

- **A / Left Arrow** – Jump to the left  
- **D / Right Arrow** – Jump to the right  
- **Double press any direction** – Perform a double jump to reach higher or distant platforms  

Mastering these simple inputs is vital to threading through tight spaces, bypassing enemies, and crossing wide gaps.  

The more you play, the better you’ll adapt to the game’s rhythm—turning challenging sequences into smooth, satisfying runs. Consistent practice will allow you to conquer the minimalist yet perilous world of Rodha.  

## Tips & Strategies for Rodha

### Master Your Movement Timing  
- Precision is key in Rodha. Wait for moving obstacles like saws and cannons to complete their cycle before jumping. Anticipating their patterns will help you avoid unnecessary deaths.  

### Utilize Double Jumps Wisely  
- Double jumps can help you clear wider gaps or dodge hazards mid-air, but avoid using them too early — you may need that second jump to save yourself from an unexpected obstacle.  

### Prioritize Coin Collection  
- Coins fuel your upgrades and allow you to purchase character skins. Take the risk of going for hard-to-reach coins only when you’ve memorized obstacle patterns for that area.  

### Checkpoints Are Your Safety Net  
- Whenever you hit a checkpoint, use it as an opportunity to experiment with tougher sections of the level. This way, you can refine your strategy without restarting from the beginning.  

### Plan Portal Transitions  
- Some levels feature portals that change your location instantly. Before entering, take a moment to understand where they lead and prepare for possible immediate hazards.  

### Customize Your Visual Comfort  
- Switch between color schemes to reduce eye strain and improve visibility of obstacles. The right contrast can make it easier to spot moving hazards and coin placements.  

### Learn from Early Levels  
- The first few levels are designed to introduce core mechanics. Treat them as training grounds — practice your jumps, timing, and hazard avoidance here to prepare for later challenges.
