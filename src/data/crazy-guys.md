## How to Play Crazy Guys

### Master the Basics
Jumping into *Crazy Guys* is quick and easy, but surviving the chaos takes skill and timing. As soon as you load into a match, you’re dropped into a colorful arena filled with moving platforms, swinging hammers, slippery ramps, and all sorts of hilarious hazards. Your goal? Stay on your feet, avoid the traps, and reach the finish line before everyone else.

You control your bouncy character using the **WASD keys** to move around. Press **Spacebar** to jump — and tap it twice to perform a **double jump** that can save you from falling or help you reach higher platforms. Move the **mouse** to rotate the camera for a better view of upcoming obstacles. If you need to interact or throw a quick punch at a rival to gain some space, use the **left mouse button** for action.

### Understanding the Objective
Each game mode in *Crazy Guys* has a straightforward objective with its own twist:
- **Race Mode:** Reach the finish line as fast as possible. Timing your jumps and dodging obstacles is essential to avoid elimination.  
- **Candy Hunt:** Collect more candies than your opponents within a limited time. Quick movement and map awareness are key to dominating the match.  
- **Soccer Mode:** Team up with friends to score goals in a chaotic arena. Use your mobility and teamwork to outplay the rival team.  
- **Elimination Mode:** Stay on moving platforms and outlast other players. Every second counts — one wrong move, and you’re out.

### Tips for Success
Customize your Crazy Guy to stand out and show personality, but also keep practicing your movement and jump timing. Mastering the physics-driven controls and maintaining momentum through obstacles separates casual contenders from true champions. Whether racing solo or battling it out with friends, every match in *Crazy Guys* is an unpredictable, laughter-filled challenge.

## Tips & Strategies for Crazy Guys

- **Master Your Movement Early**  
  Spend time getting comfortable with WASD controls, camera turning, and double jumps. Smooth movement helps you react quickly to sudden traps and keeps you ahead in races.

- **Use the Double Jump Wisely**  
  Don’t waste your double jump too early—save it for tricky gaps, sudden obstacles, or last-second height boosts to clear hazards and overtake opponents.

- **Camera Awareness Matters**  
  Always keep your camera angled to spot upcoming traps and opponent positions. This helps you anticipate hazards and plan your path effectively in chaotic environments.

- **Prioritize Objectives in Candy Hunt**  
  Focus on high-value candy locations and avoid chasing crowded spots. Position yourself strategically to collect items without constant competition slowing you down.

- **Coordinate in Soccer Mode**  
  Communicate with teammates (if possible) and stick to roles—attackers should push the ball, defenders should block opponents, and midfielders should support both ends.

- **Stay Calm in Elimination Mode**  
  Don’t rush unnecessarily; pace yourself and observe enemy movements. Successful survival often comes from smart positioning rather than constant aggression.

- **Invest in Customizations That Stand Out**  
  Unique outfits and pets aren’t just cosmetic—they help you easily identify your character in the chaos, reducing confusion and improving your spatial awareness in busy matches.
