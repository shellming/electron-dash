## How to Play FireBlob  

### Objective  
In **FireBlob**, your mission is simple yet increasingly challenging: guide a tiny, glowing fireball through a series of platform-based puzzles to reach and ignite a wooden fire at the end of each level. Along the way, you’ll use your heat abilities to melt ice blocks, clear pathways, and interact with environmental elements that help you overcome obstacles. The game’s progression introduces new mechanics and hazards every few levels, keeping gameplay fresh and engaging.  

### Movement and Controls  
FireBlob is designed with intuitive controls, perfect for both desktop and mobile browser players:  

- **Move Left/Right:** `A` / `D` keys or **Left/Right Arrow Keys**  
- **Jump:** `H`, `W`, **Up Arrow**, or **Space Bar**  
- **Mute Sound:** Press `M`  
- **Restart Level:** Press `R`  

Mastering movement is key to success. Timed jumps will allow you to navigate platforms, avoid deadly obstacles, and reach hard-to-access areas. Since precision is required in later levels, practice smooth momentum control.  

### Gameplay Mechanics  
FireBlob’s mechanics revolve around heat interaction and puzzle-solving:  

1. **Melting Ice Blocks** – Approach ice to melt it gradually, opening pathways or revealing hidden platforms.  
2. **Environmental Aids** – Some levels feature buttons, moving platforms, or other interactive objects that can help you access the goal.  
3. **Avoiding Hazards** – Beware spikes, pits, and other deadly traps that reset your progress if touched.  
4. **Platform Challenges** – As you advance, platforms may become smaller, spaced further apart, or move unpredictably.  

Each stage is designed to blend relaxing retro-style visuals with increasingly complex challenges. While the calm soundtrack sets a laid-back tone, careful timing, planning your route, and efficiently using heat abilities are required to progress through the game’s 28 levels.  

### Tips for Success  
- Always plan your jumps—platform edges may hide traps.  
- Melt ice strategically to avoid trapping yourself.  
- Restart quickly with `R` if stuck to maintain momentum.  

Whether you’re aiming for casual enjoyment or perfect runs, FireBlob rewards patience, precision, and creative problem-solving.

## Tips & Strategies for FireBlob

- **Plan Your Route Before Moving**  
  Take a moment to scan each level before rushing forward. Identify where the wooden fire lies, note slippery ice zones, and locate movable objects you can use to bridge gaps or block hazards. A few seconds of planning can save multiple restarts.

- **Master the Momentum**  
  FireBlob’s movement feels light and responsive, so small taps on the movement keys can help you control jumps precisely. Avoid overcommitting to long holds—momentum is key to staying on narrow platforms or stopping before icy edges.

- **Use Heat Abilities Wisely**  
  Not every piece of ice needs to be melted immediately. Sometimes ice platforms are essential for reaching higher areas or crossing dangerous terrain. Analyze how melting sequences affect the level’s structure before lighting everything up.

- **Restart Strategically (R Key)**  
  If you find yourself stuck or have accidentally melted a crucial block, don’t hesitate to restart. Quick resets help maintain rhythm and are part of the puzzle-solving process in FireBlob. Use them to refine your approach and conserve time.

- **Keep an Eye on Level Twists**  
  Every few levels, new mechanics are introduced—like slides, movable platforms, or changing environments. Treat each twist as an opportunity to adapt your strategy and anticipate how physics might alter blob movement.

- **Use the Environment to Create Safe Paths**  
  Objects such as boxes or movable blocks can act as temporary barriers, stopping you from sliding into hazards. Learn to manipulate these items early to create safe routes and leverage the terrain to your advantage.

- **Stay Calm and Focused**  
  Although FireBlob emphasizes relaxation, tricky jumps can test your patience. Remember that precision and observation matter more than speed. A calm, rhythmic approach will help you clear tough puzzles efficiently and enjoy the retro charm of the game.
