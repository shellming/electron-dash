## How to Play Appel  

Appel is a charming 2D platformer created by Griffpatch, designed to test your timing, reflexes, and precision. The aim is simple yet addictive: collect every golden apple in each level while avoiding tricky hazards along the way.  

### Objective  
Your primary mission in Appel is to navigate through colorful, obstacle-filled stages and gather all the golden apples scattered across the map. Completing a level requires collecting every apple, so exploration and careful movement are key. While the game’s visuals are cute and inviting, the challenges can quickly ramp up, keeping you focused and engaged.  

### Game Mechanics  
Each level is filled with platforms, moving hazards, and environmental traps designed to make your journey more difficult. You’ll encounter spikes, patrolling enemies, and narrow jumps that require precise timing. Some apples may be placed in hard-to-reach locations, demanding extra skill and persistence to collect them all.  

The gameplay is physics-based—momentum and jump height depend on how you control your movements. Mastering short and long jumps will help you reach hidden spots or dodge threats.  

### Controls  
Appel is easy to pick up thanks to its simple control scheme:  

- **Move Left/Right:** `A` or `D` keys, or the Left and Right arrow keys  
- **Jump:** `W`, Up arrow key, or Spacebar  
- **Crouch:** `S` or Down arrow key  

Crouching lets you avoid certain hazards or navigate smaller spaces. Jumping is crucial for collecting apples and evading enemies, while smooth side-to-side movement helps you navigate platforms efficiently.  

### Tips for Success  
- Plan your jumps to avoid falling into traps or missing platforms.  
- Keep an eye on moving hazards and time your advances carefully.  
- Explore every corner—some golden apples are hidden in hard-to-spot areas.  

With its straightforward controls, lively visuals, and escalating difficulty, Appel offers a satisfying blend of casual fun and skill-based platforming that will keep you coming back for another round.

## Tips & Strategies for Appel  

- **Plan Your Jumps Carefully**  
  Timing is everything in Appel. Some platforms are just far enough that a mistimed jump will send you falling. Watch the movement of obstacles and ensure you leap when there’s enough clearance.  

- **Collect Apples in the Safest Order**  
  Don’t rush for the nearest golden apple if it’s surrounded by hazards. Instead, explore the map and collect apples in an order that minimizes risk, saving dangerous pickups for when you’ve mastered the platform layout.  

- **Use Crouching to Avoid Low Obstacles**  
  Certain traps and enemies hover close to the ground. Press **S** or the down arrow key to crouch at the right moment to dodge these hazards without interrupting your forward progress.  

- **Learn Enemy Patterns**  
  Many moving obstacles and roaming enemies follow predictable paths. Observe their movement cycles before attempting to slip past, and time your actions to avoid getting hit.  

- **Master Momentum for Longer Jumps**  
  Holding the movement key while jumping gives you more forward distance. Build up speed before leaping over large gaps to ensure you don’t fall short.  

- **Use Small Pauses to Reset Your Rhythm**  
  If you keep failing a tricky section, take a short pause in-game to reset your timing and focus. Patience often leads to cleaner, more precise runs.  

- **Explore Hidden Areas for Easier Routes**  
  Some levels may offer alternative paths that are less dangerous but still lead to golden apples. Look for hidden gaps, lower ledges, or higher platforms that might give you an advantage.
