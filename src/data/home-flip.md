## How to Play Home Flip

### Master the Art of Flipping  
In **Home Flip**, your ultimate mission is simple yet hilariously challenging: make your way to your cozy bed without ever touching the floor. Instead of walking like a normal person, your character relies solely on gravity-defying flips and somersaults to navigate through rooms filled with everyday furniture and quirky hazards.

### Controls and Core Mechanics  
The game uses intuitive **one-button controls**:
- **Web/Mouse:** Press and hold the **left mouse button** to start rotating your character.  
- **Mobile:** Tap and hold the screen to initiate the flip.  
Release the button or tap to stop rotating and propel yourself toward your next surface.

The momentum and angle of your jump are determined by the timing of your button presses. A perfectly timed release can land you gracefully on a couch or shelf, while a miscalculated one might send you tumbling into a lamp—or worse, the dreaded floor.

### Navigating Your Home  
Your environment becomes a stunt-filled playground. Tables, chairs, bookcases, and countertops aren’t just obstacles—they’re your landing pads. Learn to string together a sequence of flips across these objects to progress toward your bed. The key is to keep your movement fluid and rhythmic while avoiding hazards.

The **golden rule**—and the challenge that keeps you hooked—is straightforward:  
> **DON’T TOUCH THE FLOOR!**  
If you do, you’ll need to restart the level.

### Objectives and Progression  
Each level begins on one side of a room and ends at your bed on the opposite side. The difficulty increases as new obstacles, tighter landing spots, and trickier furniture arrangements appear. Your goal is to complete each stage using the fewest flips possible, improving your accuracy and efficiency over time.

### Tips for Success  
- Use short, controlled flips for precise landings.  
- Chain flips together to cover longer gaps.  
- Watch out for momentum—over-rotating can cause a crash.  

With practice, you’ll be flipping like a pro, turning your home into the ultimate stunt arena.

## Tips & Strategies for Home Flip

- **Master Your Timing:** Every flip counts in *Home Flip*. Don’t spam clicks—time your taps or mouse presses carefully to keep your rotations controlled and precise. A well-timed flip can mean the difference between landing on the bed and crashing into the floor.

- **Study the Environment:** Each room layout introduces new objects, heights, and obstacles. Take a moment to observe the space before your first flip—look for sturdy landing spots like tables or shelves to chart your route to the bed.

- **Use Short Flips for Precision:** Holding the button longer creates higher, faster spins, which are great for covering distance. However, quick taps help with delicate landings and avoiding nearby hazards. Mix both techniques for smooth progress.

- **Plan for Momentum:** If you flip too aggressively, you might overshoot platforms. Use consecutive smaller jumps to maintain forward movement while keeping control. Momentum management is key in later stages.

- **Don’t Rush Levels:** Ragdoll physics can be unpredictable. Take your time to understand how your character reacts to bounces and edges before committing to big leaps. Practice patience—haste often leads to unnecessary resets.

- **Learn from Every Fall:** Each failed attempt teaches you about your character’s spin arc and the level’s layout. Experimentation helps refine your timing and angles, making each run more efficient than the last.

- **Watch for Hidden Routes:** Some furniture setups allow creative shortcuts. A well-aimed backflip over a lamp or side jump off a chair might reveal faster paths or safer landings that aren’t obvious at first glance.
