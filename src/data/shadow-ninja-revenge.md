## How to Play Shadow Ninja Revenge

Master the art of stealth, speed, and precision in *Shadow Ninja Revenge*, a fast-paced action-platformer that challenges you to fight your way through enemy strongholds to rescue your kidnapped son. Every level combines strategic combat with fluid movement, demanding timing, skill, and smart decision-making to survive.  

### Learn the Basics  
Your mission begins in the shadows—use your agility to sneak past or strike down Takeda’s guards as you make your way through each stage. The game starts with a short tutorial that introduces your core abilities: jumping, dashing, and attacking. You’ll quickly learn to chain movements together for seamless, acrobatic runs across rooftops, cliffs, and enemy fortresses.  

To move, use **A** or the **left arrow key** to go left, and **D** or the **right arrow key** to move right. Leap over traps and obstacles by pressing **W** or the **up arrow key**. Combat is skill-based—use **J** to throw shuriken from a distance, **K** to unleash your sword skill in close combat, and **L** to activate your disguise ability, allowing you to sneak past enemies unnoticed.  

### Advance Through the Levels  
Each stage is filled with guards, hidden treasures, and deadly traps. Explore thoroughly to find **portal scrolls**—these are essential collectibles that unlock the **torii gates**, transporting you to the next stage. Along the way, you can pick up loot that earns you currency for upgrades.  

### Upgrade Your Ninja Skills  
Between missions, invest your hard-earned points in the game’s **skill tree**. You can enhance your shuriken strength, sword speed, or disguise duration, allowing for new tactics and faster progression.  

Mastering the controls and carefully managing your abilities is the key to success. Adapt your approach, anticipate enemy patterns, and strike swiftly—only then can you defeat Takeda and bring your son home.

## Tips & Strategies for Shadow Ninja Revenge

- **Master the Art of Stealth Early**  
  Charging into battle can be tempting, but stealth is your greatest ally. Move quietly through each stage, use the disguise skill (L) when guards are nearby, and strike only when enemies are isolated to avoid being overwhelmed.

- **Time Your Dodges and Jumps Precisely**  
  Many traps and enemy projectiles require split-second reactions. Practice the timing of your jumps (W or ↑) and dashes to clear obstacles without losing health. Learning enemy attack patterns will help you anticipate danger before it hits.

- **Upgrade Wisely Through the Skill Tree**  
  Focus your early skill points on movement and cooldown reduction abilities. Increased agility and faster ability recovery can make all the difference in surviving tougher stages later in the game. Once you feel confident with mobility, invest in offensive skills.

- **Use Shuriken to Control the Battlefield**  
  Your shuriken (J) isn’t just for offense—it’s great for spacing and controlling enemy movement. Throw one to stun or eliminate distant foes before they can react, giving you a safe window to advance.

- **Explore Every Corner for Hidden Loot and Scrolls**  
  Some portal scrolls and bonus treasures are cleverly hidden behind destructible walls or high platforms. Thorough exploration will reward you with valuable experience points and currency for upgrades.

- **Balance Offense and Defense Against Bosses**  
  Boss battles demand patience and observation. Learn their attack sequences, dodge first, and strike after they expose a weak point. Rushing in too aggressively often results in heavy damage or instant defeat.

- **Keep an Eye on Environmental Cues**  
  Subtle visual hints, like flickering lights or cracked floor tiles, often signal traps or secret paths. Paying attention to your surroundings can help you avoid unnecessary damage and discover shortcuts between areas.
