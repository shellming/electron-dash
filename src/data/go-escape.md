## How to Play Go Escape

### Master the Basics
Go Escape is built around simplicity that hides a surprising depth of challenge. The entire game revolves around a single action — **jumping**. You control a small rolling ball that automatically moves forward through a variety of hazard-filled levels. Your task is to guide it safely to the end of each stage by timing your jumps perfectly.

To play, click or tap the **left mouse button** (or tap the screen on mobile devices) to make the ball jump. There are no other controls or directional inputs — success depends entirely on your timing and reflexes. Every click lifts the ball upward in a smooth arc before gravity pulls it back down. Misjudge a jump, and your ball might collide with spikes, crash into walls, or fall into a trap, forcing you to restart the level.

### Navigate the Obstacles
Each level is designed as a compact maze filled with **spikes, moving platforms, and deadly traps**. You’ll need to observe patterns and time your jumps precisely to move through tight spaces and shifting surfaces. Some platforms will slide horizontally, while others rise and fall, demanding quick reactions and adaptability. As you advance, the obstacles become faster and more complex, testing both your patience and skill.

Pay close attention to the moving elements — learning the rhythm of each trap often means the difference between escape and failure. Since the ball moves automatically, predicting where it will land after each jump is crucial to surviving.

### Aim for the Perfect Escape
Your ultimate goal in Go Escape is simple: **reach the exit without dying**. The faster and cleaner your run, the higher your sense of mastery. With each new level, the difficulty ramps up, pushing you to refine your timing and stay laser-focused. The game’s minimalist design keeps distractions to a minimum, allowing you to focus solely on precision, rhythm, and the thrill of the perfect jump.

## Tips & Strategies for Go Escape

- **Master the Timing Early**  
  Since Go Escape relies on one-button jumps, your success hinges on knowing exactly *when* to press. Practice early levels to get a feel for the ball’s momentum and jump height—this will pay off in later, trickier stages.

- **Plan Ahead for Moving Platforms**  
  Don’t just react; watch the movement patterns of platforms and traps before jumping. Sometimes waiting an extra second gives you a safer route and prevents unnecessary restarts.

- **Keep Your Eyes on Upcoming Hazards**  
  Focus not only on your immediate surroundings but also on what’s ahead. Spikes and deadly traps often appear in quick succession, so looking ahead gives you more time to prepare your jumps.

- **Stay Calm Under Pressure**  
  Speed is important, but panic leads to mistimed jumps. Maintain a steady rhythm and avoid rapid clicking unless absolutely necessary—precision matters more than speed.

- **Use Short Jumps for Tight Spaces**  
  Tap lightly for smaller jumps when navigating between closely packed traps. Overjumping can send you right into danger.

- **Memorize Difficult Sections**  
  If you fail on a particularly tough part, replay it mentally before trying again. Recognizing patterns in trap placement will help you react instinctively on your next attempt.

- **Practice in Short Bursts**  
  Because Go Escape demands focus and reflexes, short, frequent play sessions keep your reactions sharp without fatigue setting in, improving your overall performance over time.
