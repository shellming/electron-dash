## How to Play Geometry Game

### Master the Basics  
Geometry Game is a rhythm-based side-scrolling platformer where precision and timing are everything. You control a small geometric shape—usually a square—that automatically propels itself forward through a world filled with spikes, platforms, and other deadly obstacles. Your goal is simple: survive the entire level by jumping, flying, and flipping through hazards without crashing. Each level is carefully synced to the background music, so your jumps and movements align with the beats and rhythms of the soundtrack.

### Controls and Gameplay  
The controls are refreshingly simple yet demand perfect timing. **Press the spacebar or the up arrow** to jump, and **hold the key** to perform continuous jumps when needed. When your cube enters vehicle mode, such as a rocket or spaceship segment, you can **press and hold the up arrow** to ascend and **release it** to descend. Other sections may introduce gravity portals, pads, and orbs that change how your shape moves—flipping gravity upside down, boosting your speed, or launching you into the air automatically. Every input needs to be deliberate, as a single misstep sends you straight back to the start of the level.

### Objectives and Progression  
The ultimate objective of Geometry Game is to reach the end of each level without crashing. As levels progress, patterns become more complex and obstacles appear in sync with the evolving soundtrack. This makes listening critically important—keep your volume up to anticipate movements based on the rhythm.  

If a level feels too difficult, you can activate **Practice Mode**, which allows you to place checkpoints and practice individual sections repeatedly. This mode helps build muscle memory and rhythm awareness, making full runs more achievable.  

Consistency, patience, and rhythm are key. Learn the beats, time your jumps perfectly, and you’ll soon find yourself flowing through levels in perfect sync with the music.

## Tips & Strategies for Geometry Game

Mastering Geometry Game requires sharp timing, rhythm awareness, and plenty of practice. Here are some actionable strategies to help new players improve their skills and progress through even the toughest levels:

- **Start in Practice Mode**  
  Use Practice Mode to familiarize yourself with the level layout. Place checkpoints strategically at challenging parts, so you can retry without starting from scratch. This helps you build muscle memory for specific jumps and maneuvers.

- **Follow the Music's Rhythm**  
  Keep your audio on and pay attention to the beats. Many obstacles and jumps align with the music, making rhythm a key guide. Try tapping your foot along to the beat or counting in time to stay synchronized.

- **Focus on Visual Cues**  
  While the audio is important, don’t rely on it alone. Watch for repeating patterns in spikes, platforms, and moving objects. Recognizing visual sequences will help you anticipate what’s coming next.

- **Learn Portal Effects**  
  Portals can change gravity, speed, or your vehicle form. Pause Practice Mode after encountering a new portal and experiment with its effects before attempting a full run. Understanding these mechanics is crucial for survival.

- **Stay Calm After Mistakes**  
  Instant restarts can be frustrating, but keep your composure. Treat every failure as a learning opportunity—each attempt teaches you more about the level’s timing and layout.

- **Maintain Consistent Input Timing**  
  Avoid random tapping or pressing. Develop a consistent rhythm for jumps to reduce misfires and improve control, especially during fast-paced sections.

- **Gradually Increase Difficulty**  
  Start with easier levels before tackling harder ones. This helps you get comfortable with mechanics and timing, making advanced stages feel more manageable.
